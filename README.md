# Lisp
Yeah, you have probably wondered how programming langauges are built and you stumbled onto this great book on how to code your lisp. I tried building my Lisp.
This repo contains code(not really fine tuned) but easy to read code for beginners and intermediate enthusiasts like myself.
The project has used a library called mpc(I really did not write all that), code editors(use notepad++)- I used vs Code however.
Fork the project and review it yourself. There are some great insights form the project. 
Learn about pointers(they terrify me by the way), structures and other necessary concepts in C-(Beautiful daunting language)
An added bonus is to learn how langauges work and how the computer understands instructions. 
Have fun!
